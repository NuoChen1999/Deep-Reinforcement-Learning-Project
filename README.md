# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning-Project
franka_env.py builds the franka robot training environment.

training.py do the training process.

PD_Control.ipynb shows the PD controller in RL training structure.

PD_Control_External_Force.ipynb adds external force and decreases Kp gain to make PD controller works "worse" so that RL action is potential to do better.

RL_PD_Control_External_Force.ipynb adds the RL action in tau to compensate the external force.
